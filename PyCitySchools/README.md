Analysis

The first interesting result I took away from this excercise was in the Scores by School Spending portion. My initial hypothesis would havbe been that
there would be a small correlation between rising scores (Avg scores, % passing) as the spending per student increased. However, the actual data showed
the opposite. The schools in the <$584 range had the highest average scores and percentage of passing in both subjects. This surprised me, but is definitely
a possibility of reality. Higher spending per student does not always guarantee higher scores for a multitude of reasons including the possibility of
motivation of the average student in those different types of schools etc. Additionally, the higher spending could be geared towards maybe something not 
particular to Math and Reading like in the athletic department or theater or music.

Next, I found the Scores by School Size analysis to be interesting. I was not sure prior to the analysis what the results may yield, regarding maybe the 
small schools would have higher scores and percent passing as there may be more one on one learning and smaller classrooms. At the same time, I think it is
somewhat fair to assume that the larger schools would have maybe better resources and maybe better teachers. However, after performing the analysis it seems 
there is a middle ground that is the most "successful." While only marginally higher than the small schools, the medium sized schools had the highest results
across the board. I could see this making sense as it may be a perfect blend of good resources and teachers while also still having manageable classroom sizes
and sufficient assistance for each individual student.
